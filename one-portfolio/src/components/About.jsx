      <p>Junior Developer with a passion for coding. In my previous role, I had the opportunity to manage a large team of people with a common objective to deliver quality products to clients. As someone who's always worked in a fast paced environment, problem solving quickly with an optimistic demeanor has always been one of my best attributes and I'm excited to bring this quality and more to my next role.
